# My Journey
What a coincidence! I have been creating this money management app on Union Government Budget Day (Feb 1)! 

Putting my glorification of the coincidence aside, I started focusing on app development since I only have two days to complete the task. My journey began with designing the layout using Figma. Even though design is an easy job, I aimed for a simple design and focused purely on JavaScript development. I used online available code snippets and modified them to match my taste. Once that was done, I quickly fixed responsiveness, which became an easy task for me as well since I have started using Tailwind CSS more often for development.
