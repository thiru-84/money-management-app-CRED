# My Journey

What a coincidence! I have been creating this money management app on Union Government Budget Day (Feb 1)!

Putting my glorification of the coincidence aside, I started focusing on app development since I only have two days to complete the task. My journey began with designing the layout using Figma. Even though design is an easy job, I aimed for a simple design and focused purely on JavaScript development. I used online available code snippets and modified them to match my taste. Once that was done, I quickly fixed responsiveness, which became an easy task for me as well since I have started using Tailwind CSS more often for development.

Initially I focused on adding part by storing values inside variables, Once that been done with the help of eventlistener. I have updated the collected information dynamically to the table before appending it. I have come across multiple errors, undefine and many more... ChatGPT helped me resolve it ðŸ˜’. Now I can able to write 80% correct code and hopefully I will increase it gradually!

Then I have completed the delete part such is easy with .remove() method. The progress was smooth till now and once I started to focus on edit and updating the stored data, I encountered multiple issues and then I need to focus on local storage as well! I don't even have any clue about local storage. And once again I expect help from friend ChatGPT on data updating functionality and he messed my entire code. Don't trust ChatGPT.
